# Bitcoin Blockchain Technology With Focus On FPGA Miners

### Abstract:

Bitcoin is decentralized payment system and the most famous cryptocurrency which has a peer-to-peer network that operates on a cryptographic protocol. Bitcoin does not rely on any centralized entity like banks or governments to ensure the system reliability. Users send and receive bitcoins (the units of currency), directly from person to person, by broadcasting digitally signed messages to the network. Transactions are recorded into a distributed, replicated public database known as the blockchain, with consensus achieved by a proof-of-work system called mining, where miners are rearward for computing power spent to support the network. In this paper we discuss the bitcoin technology, process of Bitcoin mining, and mining hardware with focus on FPGA miners.

#### Research Aim:

The main objectives of this project are as follows.

- Learn about the bitcoin network and payment system
- Study cryptography basics, Cryptographic Hash Functions properties, data structures based on cryptography (Blockchain), and digital signature.
- Analyze bitcoin mining algorithm and SHA-256
- Study mining concept and compare the advantages of implementing bitcoin mining in different hardware.
- Learn about what FPGA is, describe the architecture of it, and how is the usage and applications of it in bitcoin mining compare to other hardware.

#### Keywords:

Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, FPGA, Cryptography, Hash function, SHA256, Blockchain, Digital signature, Mining.
